# Webplus project
An uncomplete browser android app made solely for educational purpose and to explore some fundamentals of Android programming, Kotlin-based updated version with some UI changes was later uploaded to Play store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airplay.webplus).
This app was later renamed to WS browser.
